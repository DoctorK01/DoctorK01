## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I’m Krish – a passionate Software Developer and Web Developer with a keen interest in building scalable, efficient, and creative solutions to modern problems.

💻 My journey in technology has been fueled by curiosity and hands-on learning. I enjoy working across multiple domains of software development, from system-level programming in C and C++ to object-oriented design in Java, and from dynamic front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to robust back-end integration with databases and SQL.

☁ Cloud technologies excite me, and I’m actively exploring and working with platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, and Oracle Cloud, with a growing focus on Generative AI (GenAI) and how it’s reshaping the way we build intelligent applications.

🖥 I also have strong exposure to Linux environments, shell scripting, and system-level problem-solving, which help me understand how things work under the hood.

🎨 Beyond code, I enjoy expressing creativity using tools like Canva, blending design with technology to create user-friendly and visually appealing digital experiences.

🌐 I am particularly enthusiastic about:

Full-stack web development

Cloud-native solutions

Generative AI applications

Database design and optimization

Problem-solving with Data Structures and Algorithms


🚀 My goal is to continuously improve my technical skills, contribute to impactful projects, and collaborate with like-minded developers to create innovative software solutions.

📚 I strongly believe in lifelong learning and keep expanding my knowledge base to stay aligned with the ever-evolving tech industry.

📫 Let’s connect, collaborate, and build something awesome together!
